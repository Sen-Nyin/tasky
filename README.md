## About the build

For this project I decided to better understand MVC and implement it. Tasky therefore has 3 classes: Model, View, Controller. The model class handles the data related to the tasks added. The view class handles the visual display presented by the browser. The controller class handles the logic and instructs the view and model classes what to do.

Webpack has been set up with a common config and 2 separate configs - 1 for development and 1 for production. It uses webpback-merge to join the dots. This allowed me to have separate build commands for prod and dev without having to change any settings.

I also decided to learn Tailwind with this project, so all styling has been developed using this framework.
